<h1>AndroidLib - Originally created by Regaw-Leinad (Dan Wager).</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
AndroidLib is a .Net class library, designed to make the communication between a .Net application (written in C#, VB, or VC++) and an Android device 
(phone, tablets, game console, emulator, and more) as easy as possible.
AndroidLib, originally created by Regaw-Leinad, branched off and continuously developed by me, contains classes, events, methods, and more to ensure ease of 
communication between your program and an Android device.

This version contains code, methods, and more, designed to work specifically with applications running on the .Net framework version 4.5.1 and higher.
These new improvements include asynchronous methods and functions for ADB command execution and more efficient code, due to the use of new operators in the C# language.

<h2>Downloading and using AndroidLib</h2>

<h4>Downloading the repository</h4>
To download this repository, it is recommended that you, if you do not already have one, create a new GitHub account. Should you already have a GitHub account,
please login to said account.

Once you have logged in to your GitHub account, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your own account.
From there, you can download the fork to your computer (I recommend using the [GitHub for Windows tool](http://windows.github.com)).

<h4>Using AndroidLib</h4>
Before you can use AndroidLib in your project, and after you have downloaded it to your computer, make sure you have at least Visual Studio 2013 installed.
If you do not have Visual Studio 2013 installed, you cannot open this solution, as the solution file is not backwards compatible.

<h4>Building a redistributable DLL (dynamic loaded library)</h4>
If you have Visual Studio 2013 installed, proceed to open the solution in the repository.

Once you have opened the solution, set the build configuration to Release 
(and if applicable the desired build architecture. I recommend leaving it at Mixed architecture) and hit CTRL+SHIFT+B to initiate the build process.
This might take up to several minutes depending on the speed and load of your box.

The built .dll-file will be output to bin\release inside the repository.
To use the DLL, [add it as a reference to the startup (main) project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky.aspx).

<h4>Adding the project to another solution (recommended)</h4>
In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution and select Add->Add existing project.
In the Open-dialogbox, navigate to the repository on your computer. Open the solution and double-click on AndroidLib.csproj.
The project will be added to your solution.
From there, [add the newly added project as a reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky.aspx) to use the AndroidLib library.

<h2>AndroidLib documentation</h2>
This version of AndroidLib is considered a separate project by me, and as such, I have created my own documentation, built with Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB).
The documentation for AndroidLib can be found both here, in the repository, and on my webserver.

<h2>AndroidLib on XDA-Developers.</h2>
This project was originally started by Regaw-Leinad (Dan Wager) on XDA-developers.com.
I do not want any credit for his original idea.

Please check out Dan's original [XDA-thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1512685) for [AndroidLib](http://github.com/regaw-leinad/AndroidLib)

<h2>Misc.</h2>
I have spent countless hours on this version of AndroidLib, adding, testing, and improving the features for this version of the library.
I created this separate branch of AndroidLib, to create a library that suits my needs for my programs and projects. 
I upload the changes in the hopes that it will help someone else.
Thank you for using my version of AndroidLib.
